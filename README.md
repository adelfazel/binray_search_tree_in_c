# binray_search_tree_in_c
This is implementation of BST in C as efficient as possible

Supports the following operation: 

1. node* delete_key(node* root, int key) returns new root
1. node* insertTree(node* root, int key) returns newly created node as a side effect
1. node* search(node* root, int key) returns node the contains requested key, if there is no such key returns null  
1. inOrderPrint(node* root) prints the list InOrder
1. preOrderPrint(node* root) prints the list PreOrder  
1. postOrderPrint(node* root) prints the list PostOrder

To use:
1. make tree
1. ./tree
